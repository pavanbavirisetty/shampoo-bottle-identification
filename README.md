# shampoo-bottle-identification
+ Implemented Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for a sophisticated image recognition system dedicated to identifying diverse shampoo bottles available in the market.
+ Engineered a user-friendly system providing detailed information on predicting shampoo bottles, including ingredients and manufacturing process.
+ Utilized the Adam optimizer and applied the sparse-categorical-cross entropy loss function to enhance model performance.
+ Attained a 75% accuracy rate, enabling informed consumer decisions tailored to individuals for improved hair care practices

## Directory
 + -virtual environment
 + -pred.ipynb
 + -test.ipynb
 + -models
   - -model.h5
 + -data
 + requirements.txt
## Setting up virtual environment in the pc
+ create a directory
+ open cmd from the directory
+ run the command `python -m venv #environmentname`
+ then run the command `#environmentname\scripts\activate.bat`
## Installing Dependencies
+ run the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`
+ use this link to download the model.h5 file __[model.h5](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1O-aJ1t3ArqRhpYOV78AF8M2tFRSJA_-i/view?usp=sharing)__
## How to run code
+ open `pred.py` in a compiler
+ read the desired image which need to be predicted
+ run the code in the order
+ predicted outcome is shown in the last cell of the notebook
### Since the data is huge I am not able to share the data. But, to run the model above resources works
